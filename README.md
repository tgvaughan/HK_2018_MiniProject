# C3BI molecular phylogenetics course (HK 2018) mini-project

## Title

Investigating the early dynamics of the West-African 2013-2016 Ebola virus outbreak

## Description

The Ebola virus outbreak that afflicted West Africa from 2013 to 2016
and caused the deaths of more than ten thousand people represented one
of the most densely sequenced epidemics in history. In this project
students will apply what they have learned about Bayesian phylodynamic
inference to publicly-available Ebola sequence data (collected by
multiple studies, but curated by Dudas et al., Nature, 2017) to answer
the following questions:

1. How did the effective population size (prevalence?) vary over the course of the outbreak?
2. How did the effective reproductive number R0 vary over the course of the outbreak?
3. How did the fraction of sampled infections change through time?

While a detailed investigation into any of these questions would take
much longer than the time we have available, this mini-project will
ask the students to focus on subsets of the data (restricted to
distinct regions of the Sierra Leone data, for instance) in order to
ensure tractability.  Despite this, our conclusions will be real and
demonstrate the power of phylodynamics methods in addressing problems
of real importance.

## Data
  
The data for this project are in the data/ directory.

Note that these genomes were taken from the set curated by
Dudas et al., Nature, 2017 which the authors have
made available at https://github.com/ebov/space-time.
